Hi! My name is Martin. I'm a chemical engineer specialized in the corrosion of pipelines
in oil and gas scenarios. My interests are broad and include scientific research, woodworking, programming,
and outdoor pursuits. I'm currently abroad in Abu Dhabi, UAE on an internship at The Petroleum Institute,
a university focused on all things oil and gas.
